## Overview
KOKLIKO DNS Blocker is a small but powerful desktop application that enables MikroTik users to easily manage website filtering functionality on their routers. Designed to empower non-technical users, the app simplifies the process of blocking and unblocking specific websites during working hours or at any preferred time.
